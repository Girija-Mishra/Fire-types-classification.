# ðŸ”¥ Fire Types Classification in India using MODIS Satellite Data

Internship Project under **Edunet Foundation â€“ Shell Skills4Future (Green Skills & AI)**

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To classify different fire types in India using MODIS satellite data (2021â€“2023) by applying machine learning techniques.  
This supports environmental sustainability by enabling better fire detection and analysis.
