# Fire-types-classification.
ðŸ”¥ Fire Type Classification in India using MODIS Satellite Data
Internship Project under Edunet Foundation â€“ Shell Skills4Future (Green Skills & AI)

ðŸ“Œ Objective
To classify different fire types in India using MODIS satellite data (2021â€“2023) by applying machine learning techniques. This supports environmental sustainability by enabling better fire detection and analysis.

ðŸ“Š Tasks Performed
Loaded and merged MODIS fire datasets

Cleaned and preprocessed the data

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Fire type distribution

Brightness, confidence, FRP, and temporal trends

Built and evaluated classification models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Assessed model performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices

âœ… Status
Project initialized, data loaded, analysis and classification models implemented.
